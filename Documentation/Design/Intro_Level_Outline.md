# Sample Level Outline

Level 0 serves as the player's introduction to the game mechanics and storyline. First, the player learns the controls and core gameplay loop. Once the player is familiar with their situation, the core challenge of the level is introduced, which will unblock progression into subsequent levels. At this stage, the primary antagonist is not yet introduced.The story for this level is composed of the following "scenes," or high-level story elements.

## Setup

The player starts in their company's on-premises data center. Here, they are assigned various operations tasks such as installing server equipment and plugging in cables. After the player completes basic tasks that familiarize them with the core controls, they are instructed to power on a new server. This causes an electrical accident that results in the player blacking out, bringing them into the next scene.

## Introduction

After blacking out, the player wakes up in a virtual world. The world, mostly empty, represents their company's AWS account, which had been only used for basic backups. Within the backup infrastructure, a moving character is brought into focus. As the player approaches, the character introduces herself as Cloud Hosted Learning Objective Enablement (CHLOE). CHLOE, an intern AI project left in the company's codebase, helps the player understand their situation, and explains that the player can return to their body once their company's IT team better understands how the accident occurred.

## Gameplay Loop

The core gameplay loop is introduced at this point. CHLOE instructs the player that, to help the IT team understand the situation, the player will need to collect logging from the environment where they are currently trapped. CHLOE walks the player through creation and configuration of Amazon Simple Storage Service (Amazon S3) buckets that will be used to store log data.

## Interruption

As the player is creating buckets based on CHLOE's suggestions, they are interrupted by system mail. The mail messages originate from the on-premises IT team, who have found a way to communicate with the player, establishing a link to their original form. The IT team requests additional resources and configuration, leading to the "main" mission of the level.

## Level Complete

After the player creates the resources with the configuration requested by the IT team, they are congratulated by CHLOE. An additional message is received, this time from the player's HR team. As a result of the runaway electrical accident, all on-premises IT infrastructure has been destroyed. In order to return home, the player must first rebuild their company's operations in AWS.
