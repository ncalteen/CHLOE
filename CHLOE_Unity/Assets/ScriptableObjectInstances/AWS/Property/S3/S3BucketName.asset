  Description: "The following rules apply for naming buckets in Amazon S3:\r\n\r\n-
    Bucket names must be between 3 and 63 characters long.\r\n\r- Bucket names can
    consist only of lowercase letters, numbers, dots (.), and hyphens (-).\r\n\r-
    Bucket names must begin and end with a letter or number.\r\n\r- Bucket names
    must not be formatted as an IP address (for example, 192.168.5.4).\r\n\r- Bucket
    names must not start with the prefix xn--.\r\n\r- Bucket names must not end with
    the suffix -s3alias. This suffix is reserved for access point alias names. For
    more information, see Using a bucket-style alias for your access point.\r\n\r-
    Bucket names must be unique within a partition. A partition is a grouping of
    Regions. AWS currently has three partitions: aws (Standard Regions), aws-cn (China
    Regions), and aws-us-gov (AWS GovCloud [US] Regions).\r\n\r- Buckets used with
    Amazon S3 Transfer Acceleration can't have dots (.) in their names. For more
    information about Transfer Acceleration, see Configuring fast, secure file transfers
    using Amazon S3 Transfer Acceleration."
