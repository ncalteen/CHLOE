# Cloud Hosted Learning Objective Enablement (CHLOE)

**Disclaimer:** This is very much a work-in-progress. All design, documentation, etc. is written from the point of view of a completed product...*which CHLOE is far from*.

The [CHLOE_Unity](./CHLOE_Unity) project contains the current source code for the proof of concept game.

At the moment, my goal is to build out [Level 0](./Documentation/Design/Levels/Level_00_S3.md) and have players give feedback on the concept as a whole.

## Overview

Cloud Hosted Learning Objective Enablement (CHLOE) is game-based training simulation for visual learners. CHLOE's single-player, story-driven game teaches players core AWS services, concepts, and best practices using the [AWS Well-Architected Framework](https://aws.amazon.com/architecture/well-architected/). In Simulation Mode, players can use CHLOE to render AWS accounts as 3D environments where they are able to view, launch, update and terminate resources in real-time. CHLOE provides contextual training to solve real-world problems through audiovisual explanations and tutorials, as well as animated architecture demonstrations.

Current Cloud training focuses on text-/console-based tasks. Cloud architecture is often restricted to static, 2D diagrams. This does not always lend itself well to the many resources and relationships involved in building on AWS. Searching for answers online lacks important context, and existing training requires users dedicate time away from building. Making decisions and communicating architecture designs across multiple teams and organizations has been an ongoing challenge with existing tools, which lack fidelity and reduce the data available to decision-makers.

The story of CHLOE's Game Mode starts with a data center incident causing the player to be stuck inside their company's AWS account. To return to the real world, the player must rebuild their company's broken applications on AWS using the Well-Architected Framework. As a separate experience, Simulation Mode lets players design solutions and get contextual answers to complex scenarios. Players can use existing accounts to build dynamic, 3D architecture diagrams and live workloads in real-time.

In Game Mode, players earn badges by completing tasks, which can be used to showcase their knowledge to the AWS community. In Simulation Mode, players can create 3D architecture diagrams, or synchronize with their AWS accounts in real-time. View filters for the Well-Architected Pillars provide feedback on areas of strength or improvement. Players can use the in-game assistant, CHLOE, for just-in-time (JIT) training, providing contextual information while building.

## Contribute

I come from what I like to think is a decent DevOps background. I can generally pick up a cloud service and make it do something that resembles useful work. Unity and C# are a new area, though.

If you're interested in contributing to the game asset fund, please use any of the links below. Donations would be used solely for the purchase or license of assets and code that will either be part of CHLOE itself or part of what brings CHLOE to life.
